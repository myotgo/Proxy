### Purchase notes:
- Operating system: **Ubuntu**
- Cheap plan is sufficient
- Location is your choice

**Required information from server:**
- Server IP
- Username: root
- Password

Step 2: SSH Connection
--------------------------------------------------

**[Guide to Connecting to Server with SSH](../ssh-connection.en.md)**

Summary:
```bash
ssh root@SERVER-IP
```

Step 3.1: Access the Management Panel

### SSL Certificate Warning

Your browser will show a security warning. This is because we use a self-signed SSL certificate, and it is completely safe.

Click **Advanced**:

![SSL Warning](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4a18b53a-eaaa-4e51-b9c7-d21812eb855e)

Then click **Proceed to IP (unsafe)**:

> We use a self-signed SSL certificate so the panel works over HTTPS (without needing to purchase a certificate). Because of this, the browser does not find this site in its trusted certificate list.

![Proceed](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4f763fcc-5bb8-4c0a-b96f-e09285652788)

### Log In to the Panel

The login page will appear. You can change the language to Persian if you prefer.

### Management Panel

This is your server management panel. You can add or delete users from here:

![Management Panel](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5262345c-7f4d-47d4-bc38-34dff8dd7111)

The panel offers different methods for different layers. Currently, only the first 3 layers work in Iran, and it is recommended to use the first one as it performs better:
